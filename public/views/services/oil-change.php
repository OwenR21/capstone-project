                <h2>What is an Oil Change?</h2>
                <p>Regular oil changes are essential maintenance tasks for any vehicle. 
                    Engine oil lubricates the internal components of the engine, helping
                    to reduce friction and heat. Over time, oil can become contaminated
                    with dirt, debris, and engine by-products, leading to decreased lubrication
                    efficiency and potential engine damage. An oil change involves draining
                    the old oil from the engine and replacing it with fresh, clean oil to
                    ensure optimal engine performance and longevity. Oil changes are typically
                    recommended every 3,000 to 5,000 miles, depending on your vehicle's make,
                    model, and driving conditions. It's essential to follow your vehicle 
                    manufacturer's recommendations for oil change intervals to maintain engine 
                    health and performance.</p>

                <h2>Why is an Oil Change Important?</h2>
                <p>During an oil change, a technician will drain the old oil from the engine,
                    replace the oil filter, and refill the engine with fresh, high-quality
                    motor oil. They may also perform a visual inspection of the engine and
                    other vital components to check for any signs of wear or potential issues.
                    Regular oil changes help to keep your engine running smoothly and efficiently.
                    Fresh oil provides better lubrication, helps to prevent engine wear and tear,
                    and improves fuel efficiency. Neglecting oil changes can lead to increased
                    engine friction, overheating, and costly repairs down the line.</p>
