                <h2>What is Tire Service?</h2>
                <p>Tire service encompasses a range of maintenance procedures designed to ensure the safety, performance, and longevity of your vehicle's tires. Tires are the only contact point between your vehicle and the road, making them essential for traction, handling, and braking. Tire service includes tasks such as tire rotation, tire balancing, tire inflation, tire repair, and tire replacement.<br>

                <strong>Tire Rotation: </strong>Tire rotation involves moving the tires from one position to another on the vehicle to promote even tread wear and extend tire life. This helps to ensure that all four tires wear evenly and maintain optimal traction and handling characteristics.<br>

                <strong>Tire Balancing: </strong>Tire balancing involves adjusting the distribution of weight around the tire and wheel assembly to ensure smooth and vibration-free operation. Proper tire balancing helps to prevent uneven tire wear, reduce vibration, and improve vehicle stability and ride comfort.<br>

                <strong>Tire Inflation:</strong> Proper tire inflation is critical for maintaining tire performance, fuel efficiency, and safety. Underinflated or overinflated tires can lead to reduced traction, increased tire wear, decreased fuel efficiency, and potential blowouts. Regular tire inflation checks and adjustments are essential for optimal tire performance and longevity.<br>

                <strong>Tire Repair: </strong>Tire repair involves patching or plugging punctured tires to restore their integrity and prevent air loss. Proper tire repair procedures ensure that the tire maintains its structural integrity and can safely carry the vehicle's weight.<br>

                <strong>Tire Replacement: </strong>Tire replacement is necessary when tires become worn beyond their safe usable life or damaged beyond repair. It's essential to replace tires promptly to maintain vehicle safety and performance.</p>

                <h2>Why is Tire Service Important?</h2>
                <p>Proper tire service is essential for maintaining vehicle safety, performance, and longevity. Regular tire maintenance helps to ensure even tread wear, optimal traction, and handling characteristics, reducing the risk of accidents and improving overall driving comfort and control.

                    By performing regular tire service, you can maximize tire life, improve fuel efficiency, and reduce the risk of costly tire-related repairs or replacements. Additionally, proper tire maintenance contributes to vehicle stability, braking performance, and overall driving safety.
                    Tire service is recommended at regular intervals and whenever you notice signs of tire wear, damage, or performance issues. As a general guideline:<br>

                        <strong>Tire rotation:</strong> Every 6,000 to 8,000 miles or as recommended by your vehicle manufacturer.<br>
                        <strong>Tire balancing: </strong>Whenever you replace tires or notice vibrations while driving.<br>
                        <strong>Tire inflation:</strong> Check tire pressure monthly and adjust as needed, especially before long trips or changes in temperature.<br>
                        <strong>Tire repair:</strong> Whenever you notice a puncture or damage to a tire.<br>
                        <strong>Tire replacement: </strong>When tires are worn beyond the tread wear indicators or damaged beyond repair.</p>
